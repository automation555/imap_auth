IMAPAuthenticatable
===================

A quick library for authenticating against an IMAP server.

It expects a model with a 'username' column  You must pass a host.

Example:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  imap_authenticatable :host => 'mail.hope.edu'
  
  ...
end


other options:
	:allow_new_users => true/false
		Alters whether to use find_by_username or find_or_create_by_username.
		The default is true.
	:default_domain => 'example.com'
		What usernames have at the end.
		Defaults to the :host option.
	:append_domain => false/true
		Should we always add or remove the default_domain (with preceding '@) value?
		The default is false (always remove).
		

Other options may be added as need arises.
